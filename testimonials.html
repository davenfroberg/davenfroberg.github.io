He always gave helpful, concise feedback on my programs without giving away any solutions which contributed greatly to my learning in the course. Additionally, he always explained concepts that I didn't fully understand in a way that I could more clearly understand them. Even when I finished my code for a lab, he would point out potential flaws in my final code which helped me become more aware of aspects of my coding skills that could be improved upon."
