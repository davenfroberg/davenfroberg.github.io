            <p id="description-p">I am a third-year BSc. Computer Science student at the University of British Columbia. <br> <br>

                Passionate about inclusive software development, my dream is a career in building software to enhance the lives of all individuals, 
                particularly those with disabilities. I aim to contribute to a digital environment that fosters autonomy and agency for everyone, 
                regardless of their abilities. <br><br>
                
                Beyond academics, I thrive on meeting new people and continuously improving in everything I do. Learning is a 
                deep-seated passion of mine, and I'm excited to see where my post-secondary studies lead me in my professional career. <br><br>
                
                When I'm not busy with work or school, I find joy in playing hockey, capturing moments through photography, watching sports, and exploring the great outdoors.
